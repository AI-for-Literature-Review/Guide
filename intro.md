# Introduction

Welcome to this Jupyter Book on Generative AI in research.

## Structure of the Guide

This guide works as a reference guide for all the steps in the literature review. 

We recommend that you first read the basics about AI tools for a literature review before heading to the specific sections. It will help you understand how the different types of tools work and how they can be applied effectively.

For each phase of the literature review, we have included a short recap on the standard way of conducting a literature review, to connect to your pre-existing knowledge. Following this you will find examples on how AI can help support the literature review, and what types of tools are helpful.

Our goal is to provide you with foundational knowledge about the types of tools and how to use them in a literature review, so you are able to start working with them in the phase that you are in.
